Gold light dappling across a valley that seems to reach on forever. 
We ease back, revealing more - taking in the visual feast - finally 
discovering a seated figure facing out over the valley - a DOG at 
his feet. 

</p><p><p ID="act">VIRGIL ANDERSON, life ahead of him - someone seemingly at ease with 
himself. As we watch. him a moment - SOUNDS become prominent - 
whistle of the wind through the grass - a bird's wings as it takes 
flight - a tree branch creaking under its own weight. And as he sits 
there, listening, we see the last rays of sunlight slip from the 
day. 

</p><p><p ID="act">BLACK - and our TITLES come up.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Sign? I was looking for a sign? There's no...


</p><p><p ID="act">Her attention is caught by something off camera. She stares out into 
the night.. 

</p><p><p ID="act">HER POV - A small iced over pond - and in the middle - moving about 
is Virgil, ICE SKATING - hockey stick in hand - moving about the

<P ID="dia">Yes... I took the first ..... no, no, I'm listening...


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil winds up and takes a slap at the ice with his stick - throws 
his hands up in the air like he just scored.

unless you hear from Atlanta. And fax me the

</p><p><p ID="act">Beep she hangs up. Looks back out to the pond. It's empty. Shrugs - 
about to pull out - that love song still blaring. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

she's exhausted - and starts towards the entrance.

Do you have anything that just involves lying down?

the door: 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WOMAN'S VOICE
<P ID="dia">Virgil, Oh God..., right there. Yes.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy's interest piques - the woman's murmur continuing - deep 
ecstasy. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WOMAN'S VOICE
<P ID="dia">Yes there - a bit more...

<P ID="dia">--wait - wait, you can't stop - one more minute - noo! 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL'S VOICE
<P ID="dia">Sorry, Susan - time's up. 
I've got someone waiting.


</p><p><p ID="act">And the door opens - and we see a woman, 60's, 
SUSAN, Bette Midler type, backing out of the room. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUSAN
<P ID="dia">Virgil, you have to come live with me.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL'S VOICE
<P ID="dia">And what would your husband say? 
Amy, you out there? - c'mon in.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUSAN
<P ID="dia">That's it - I'm getting a divorce.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy smiles as she passes Susan and enters. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. VIRGIL'S MASSAGE ROOM - DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil has his back to us as he prepares the table. The room is very 
ordered - every vial, bottle, towel has its exact spot. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Hey, Amy, I'm Virgil - why don't you 
get ready - hop up on the table.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy sees Virgil - his head turned slightly away - she drops her 
sweats and lies on the table, face down - pulling the sheet to cover 
herself. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Sounds like you're a genius at this.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="spkdir">(laughs)
<P ID="dia">That's right.. Mozart, Einstein, Virgil Anderson, massage therapist. 
Now I'm going to start working somewhat deep -
you let me know if you want anything deeper.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Deeper is good - where I come from, 
all you get is shallow.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">I like that - deep it is.


</p><p><p ID="act">CLICK - he hits a button on a CD player and as we hear the soulful 
aria "Mira, 0 Norma" from Bellini's Norma. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">First time in Pinecrest?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Came in late last night.. 
missed the town completely.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">If you came in broad daylight, 
you could still miss the town completely.


</p><p><p ID="right">DISSOLVE TO:

</p><p><p ID="act">Slow moving cuts of Virgil, working long strokes over Amy's body - - 
his hands gracefully LENGTHENING and STRETCHING her muscles. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Too much compute? work.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Uh-huh.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Bad chair - you should think about a change.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="spkdir">(quiet)
<P ID="dia">Absolutely.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil reaches his hands all the way down her spine and makes a move 
that causes Amy to release a very deep guttural sound. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Too deep?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">No.. ..... just right.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy is now lost in another world - as Virgil shifts - working gently 
- not caressing - but molding - like a sculptor. 

</p><p><p ID="act">A moment and Amy, surprisingly, begins to cry - softly. Virgil stops 
- takes a step back. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">I - I'm sorry - it was too deep...


</p><p><p ID="act">She cries for another few beats - then takes a breath. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">No - it.. It's not you..
It's just things have kinda built up, 
I don't know why I'm crying.. look, 
this is embarrassing...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Don't be embarrassed - 
you obviously needed it. 
We should stop for today.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Yeah, thanks.
You always make the girls cry.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Not since grade school. 
I'm going to go now - unless you'd like me to stay.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Could you - just for a minute?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Of course, whatever you need.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil sits next to her - then reaches out - takes her hand and 
starts a slow comforting massage - we see Amy visibly relax. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">You ever feel like a Martian's
invaded your entire body?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Every day.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy, closes her eyes - smiling slightly in thanks. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. VIRGIL'S MASSAGE ROOM - LATER 

</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA pans slowly over to Amy asleep - and on the click of the door 
- her eyes dreamily open. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Virgil?


</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - LATE DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Hallway outside the massage area. Amy exits the change room, now 
wearing her sweats - pulling on her sneakers. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL (O.S.)
<P ID="spkdir">(calling out)
<P ID="dia">Hey Caroline, you look incredible today.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE (O.S.)
<P ID="spkdir">(laughing)
<P ID="dia">Quite a compliment, Virgil. See ya tomorrow.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL (O.S.)
<P ID="dia">See ya.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy looks down the hall - sees a glimpse of Virgil rounding the 
corner. She chases after hi~n into the reception area where she sees 
him exiting the door and moving of f down the driveway. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Virgil - wait...


</p><p><p ID="act">He's gone. Hopping along, tugging on her last sandal - she decides 
to go after him - fighting her way through a large tour group just 
checking in. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. BEAR MTN. SPA - LATE DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil in the distance, moving his way towards the main street. Amy 
exiting the building - trying not to slip on the ice as she, hurries 
after him - trying to get close enough to call out. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil stops at a main roadway as Amy comes up behind him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Virgil, hey.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil turns - sunglasses on - looks directly at Amy. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Yes.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">It's Amy - Amy Tremont.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Of course - you were sleeping, 
didn't want to wake you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Yes thanks - you're the skater, right - 
I saw you last night, coming in. 
Pretty mean slapshot. 
You play on some team or something?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Yeah, something. You a hockey fan?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Always liked it - never get around to 
seeing a game. But I loved to skate 
as a kid - unfortunately I have two left feet.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="spkdir">(playing with her) 
<P ID="dia">They look perfectly OK with me.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy laughs, starts relaxing - unconsciously starts to flirt. Head 
cocked, shifts her weight on one foot, moving slightly closer. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">I love the view you get here.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Same here - I never get used to it.


</p><p><p ID="act">Just then a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up in front of him and WHOOSH 
the doors pop open revealing CARL KIPLING, black, a hundred years 
old. Virgil turns as a few kids pile off the bus.. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Well, this is my ride. 
Hey Tommy, my man.


</p><p><p ID="act">And with his hand extended a kid high fives it. Amy looks up - a BUS 
full of young school kids. Seems odd. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">TOMMY
<P ID="dia">Virge.


</p><p><p ID="act">As the kid moves off. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Well, I just wanted to apologize for back there - 
blubbering like that - I was just in a weird place.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">And now...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Now, I'm fine - so I wanted to 
thank- you. For what you did.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">For making you cry.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">No, I made me cry - and you handled 
it great - didn't freak or anything.
<P ID="spkdir">(beat)
<P ID="dia">Is my mascara smeared or something?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="spkdir">(laughs)
<P ID="dia">No. Why?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">You're just looking at me funny.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">CARL
<P ID="dia">Virgil - lets move it.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">As I said earlier - I just never get used to the view.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil starts towards the bus, reaching behind to his pack. Pulls 
something out. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">See you tomorrow.


</p><p><p ID="act">And CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - a WHITE CANE unfolds in his hand. And he 
taps his way to the bus. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">See you... oh my God.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">What?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">You're, you're -- I'm so sorry.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="spkdir">(smile)
<P ID="dia">Hey, you already apologized once 
- no need to overdo it. Bye now.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy doesn't know how to respond. And he moves into the front seat of 
the bus - amongst "Hey Virgil's" from the school kids and Ca-chunk 
the doors close - the Yellow Bus steaming off - past Amy, as she 
stares at Virgil in the front seat - about to wave to him - then 
realizing he wouldn't see. 

</p><p><p ID="act">As she turns and watches the bus move off down the street - a hand 
comes out - Virgil's - and waves good-bye. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. VIRGIL'S HOME.- DUSK 

</p><p><p ID="act">The BUS stopping in front of Virgil's home - a side-by-side DUPLEX 
at the edge of surrounding woods. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil steps into the street and with a HONK the bus pulls away. He 
turns, grazes his hand across a tree out front - and starts towards 
his home. 

</p><p><p ID="act">AT THE PORCH - he hesitates at the first door. Finds it with his 
hand - then raps on it. 

</p><p><p ID="act">No answer. He moves over to his own door - and goes inside. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EVENING 

</p><p><p ID="act">As he enters, Sophie, an aging LAB, lays on the couch. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Get of f the couch, Sophie.


</p><p><p ID="act">As the dog slides guiltily off the couch. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Some seeing eye dog - 
more like sleeping eye dog.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil bends down as he passes the coffee table to pick up the 
REMOTE CONTROL placed just so. Click - a Game Show pops on. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Met a girl today - nice voice -
followed me out of the building.


</p><p><p ID="act">Sophie barks. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">No she wasn't a stalker.


</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE ON Virgil's hand flipping open a large book marked "TV HOCKEY 
SCHEDULE" - it's completely WHITE - all in BRAILLE. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE (O.S.)
<P ID="dia">Sophie's just worried about you - 
she watches too many horror movies.


</p><p><p ID="act">In the kitchen, JENNIE ANDERSON, older than Virgil, simply dressed, 
putting a just made dinner carefully onto a plate. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Hey, you're here - so how 
are the kids today?


</p><p><p ID="act">Running his hand down the pure white page - he finds what he wants: 
BAP - he hits the channel changer and the game comes on. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">The usual - need a lot of attention. So who's the girl?


</p><p><p ID="act">Moving into the kitchen, Virgil puts the remote to the side of the 
refrigerator where it VELCRO sticks to an exact spot. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">From the spa. I made her cry.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">You haven't done that since-- 


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL/JENNIE
<P ID="dia">-- grade school.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="spkdir">(smile)
<P ID="dia">That's what I told her. Coke?


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil moves past Jennie as she goes into the living room - hand up, 
door open and he's got a glass. Back to the fridge, he grabs a coke. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">I'm fine. Your dinner's ready - chicken's 
at 3 o'clock - rice is at...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">6 o'clock, peas at 9 o'clock 
and news at 11.


</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie places Virgil's dinner down in an exact spot on a coffee 
table (facing away from the TV). 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="spkdir">(laughs)
<P ID="dia">One day I'm going to switch them on you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">And one day I'll play forward 
for the New York Rangers.


</p><p><p ID="act">Four precise steps into the room and Virgil plops down on the sofa - 
finds his fork. Jennie moves to a counter where a pile of school 
books sit. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE

</p><p><p ID="act">Ha - ha. You need new jokes.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Or a new sister. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">I'd work on the jokes.


</p><p><p ID="act">Picking up the books she moves past Virgil - pecks him on the head 
and moves to the door.

<P ID="dia">You want to grade some spelling tests? 
<P ID="spkdir">(beat)
<P ID="dia">I'll be next door you need me.


</p><p><p ID="act">She leaves and Virgil pats the couch and Sophie hops up next to him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">You know this girl - for one moment -
she actually thought I could
<P ID="spkdir">(Sophie grumbles as she settles in) 
<P ID="dia">I'm not kidding. 
<P ID="spkdir">(beat) 
<P ID="dia">And she had this great voice - relaxing - 
soft like a breeze through
<P ID="spkdir">(beat)
<P ID="dia">Wonder what she thinks about "blind dates." 


</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. AMY'S ROOM - EVENING 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy in bed - just out of the shower - the only light in the room 
comes from the TV. She has the remote, mindlessly switching channels

</p><p><p ID="act">Click - an Odd Couple rerun - click - ESPN bowling - click - Three 
Stooges - Moe poking Curly in the eye - click - click - click. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Bored, she stops - notices a small scarf on a chair next to the bed. 
She picks it up, holds it against her eyes and ties it tight around 
her head. 

</p><p><p ID="act">She stands - hands out in front of her - starts to walk across the

- he's got a laugh like a donkey - we sometimes listen to games
together - he's a Devil's fan. And just up ahead should be Grady's 
junk shop - he calls it "antiques"...
Smells like junk. I'd hate to see what it looks like

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

</p><p><p ID="act">They run in laughing - Amy closing the door behind them as Virgil 
moves his way into the center of the room - stands where the 
moonlight from a high window hits the floor. Water runs down the 
outside glass, causing the light to ripple across him. The room is 
empty - almost surreal. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">I can't believe how fast it happens...

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil slowly moves his head about, sensing the room. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Listening - the rain - it brings out the 
contours of everything, gives life to 
a room I can't see.


</p><p><p ID="act">WE SEE SLOW MOVING CUTS of the building as Virgil describes what he 
hears. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You hear it?...on the roof dripping down the 
walls on every side. On the right, on the 
drainpipe, it's drumming with a deeper, 
steadier sound - - like a timpani - echoing 
across the room - tells me the room is large 
- open. You feel it - in your chest? On the left, 
the rain says... (he listens)
...a fire escape, with it's own rhythm 
- ping - ping. Then listen - there...
<P ID="spkdir">(he points)
<P ID="dia">--what's that - over there...?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Looks like it's...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">No, listen for it - not what it 
looks like - what it becomes. 
Come here.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy moves closer - Virgil puts his hands out on her shoulders - 
turns her to the sound. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Now just listen to it - shut out
everything but that sound - 
do you hear it?


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy strains to listen - closes her eyes - her head instinctively 
turning - no in unison with Virgil's 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Yes - there - it's soft - like a shimmer


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">The wind blowing the rain against a window.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="spkdir">(smile)
<P ID="dia">Like a cymbal. It's like our own

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy opens her eyes - looks about the room - listening. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">The world is invisible to me - with my touch it comes 
alive. But only one thing at a time. But when it's raining,
I feel everything at once. Sometimes, I wish it could 
rain inside rain all around us.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

<P ID="dia">"Einfuehlung."


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">What?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Einfuehlung - it's an architectural term. 
It means to share an empathy. 
Been a long time since I felt that.


</p><p><p ID="act">And as they stand listening to the rain, playing its music - Amy 
watches him - fascinated by him - then shivers slightly. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You're cold, we should go.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">No, I'm fine, really. It was just something passing 
through me - can't explain it - a good thing.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy smiles at him - then quietly realizes 
he can't see it. She moves close, her 
hand reaching out and taking his. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">What you just showed me x85 how 
I feel - makes me smile.


</p><p><p ID="act">She takes his hand - hesitates - then puts it on the side of her 
face. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">I see it now. Thank-you.


</p><p><p ID="act">We hold a beat - enjoying the symphony of rain - then cut to: 

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. BEAR MTN. LODGE - MORNING

you'd never get up on my table again.

for a complete nervous breakdown.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">I love a challenge.


</p><p><p ID="act">And as he places his palms carefully on her back - working her back 
slowly we hear opera play quietly in the background. 

</p><p><p ID="right">DISSOLVE TO:
</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil's hands on the small of her back - something amazingly 
sensual about how he works her muscles. Amy speaks to him in low 
tones - in a state of complete relaxation. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Can I ask how long you've been blind?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Of course, most people avoid the subject. You tell them 
you're blind and they act surprised. "You're blind? Reallv? 
I didn't know - you hide it so well." And then they wave their
hand in front of your face just to make sure.
<P ID="spkdir">(beat)
<P ID="dia">It started when I was a little over a year old.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil's hands move down Amy's sides - slow - feeling each contour - 
the oil making her skin glisten. Amy moves her head slightly with 
his touch. She lets out a small breath of air. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="spkdir">(quiet)
<P ID="dia">You see shadows?

I just don't have the fifth one. I can't hear things in 
Vermont, can't smell if you're mad at me, and, no 
- I don't know Helen Keller, Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy murmurs in response to Virgil's touch. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">No, I just - this feels nice - too nice.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil moves his hands down her back - sensually kneading each 
muscle. It's clear he's enjoying this as much as she is. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">You're very good.. at what you do.


</p><p><p ID="act">Another breath exhales from her involuntarily as Virgil hits a

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">You enjoy it.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">At times. Some clients make it 
more enjoyable than others.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil now works down her thighs - Amy's back arching slightly with 
the movement - both of them heating to the moment. Both their 
breaths quickening. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">And this client...

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy sits up on the table - the sheet pulling away slightly revealing 
her. For a moment she watches him - his head turned towards her -

<P ID="dia">I need more than that, Betsy. For once in a

<P ID="dia">No, no. I can tell he's sensing everything about 
me with a simple touch. He listens to my every 
word as if it's the only sound on the planet - 
I feel like even though he can't see me, he knows 
everything about me. He just moves me - does that

</p><p><p ID="act">The FROZEN POND, nestled against a strand of pine. Virgil skates 
fast across the ice enjoying the speed - the wind using his hockey 
stick as a guide - he nears the edge of pond - feels it with the 
stick and slams to a stop. 

</p><p><p ID="act">He shuffles his body around to face in the other direction - then 
starts skating again - passing AMY standing on the snow covered 
bank. 

</p><p><p ID="act">ON AMY - smiling, watching Virgil - enjoying his release of energy. 

</p><p><p ID="act">HER POV - VIRGIL - skating well, a look of relaxation we've never 
seen on his face. He skates in an arc coming back past Amy. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Finally she speaks. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

Didn't mean to scare you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Amy?!


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Watching you? Just got here - 
couldn't find you at the spa - took
a chance you'd be here. You're very good.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Skated since I was a kid. My dad taught me 
- wanted me to play pro one day. 
How do you like my pond?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

<P ID="dia">I think so - keep going.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

the horizon, protecting it from 
the outside world.

<P ID="dia">You want to skate?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Sorry, I didn't bring my skates.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Don't need them. Come on step hold of my stick.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Excuse me?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="spkdir">(smile) 
<P ID="dia">Hockey stick. Here.


</p><p><p ID="act">He holds the stick out like a cross bar. Amy moves cautiously 
forward and takes hold of it. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">OK. Now hold on for balance. 
I used to do this with Jennie when we were kids.


</p><p><p ID="act">And Virgil starts skating backwards pulling Amy with him. Amy is 
apprehensive at first then starts to enjoy the movement - the 
sensation - both of them laughing out loud. 

</p><p><p ID="act">WIDE as we see them move about the rink - Amy sliding and being 
pulled by Virgil. As he picks up speed we hear Amy scream in 
delight. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Look out - we're running out of ice.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil turns expertly, arcing around the edge of the ice but Amy 
loses her nerve - and balance - and lets go of the stick and goes 
flying into an embankment. The momentum carries Virgil off down the 
ice - both of them laughing hysterically. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You OK?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Fine. Never been dumped so fast in my life.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Me, dump you? No way. Stay where you are 
- I'll come to you - just keep talking.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy sits up on her elbows in the embankment. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">What do I say?


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil starts gliding across the ice searching for Amy. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="spkdir">(hearing her voice, veering in her direction) 
<P ID="dia">Anything - how'd you become an architect?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">God - let's see - I was in college - 
art school - a little aimless - and I met
this guy -. an architect - opened up a new 
world to me. I liked the structure the 
control - finding problems, coming up with 
solutions - when I graduated - we started 
a company together - on impulse got married
- which was crazy - divorced a year ago - 
but we're still partners.. which must seem
even crazier.


</p><p><p ID="act">And Virgil's suddenly there - going a little too far - tumbling off 
the pond and into her. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You'd think I meant to do that. 
A patented move.


</p><p><p ID="act">They're close - in the snow together - face to face. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="spkdir">(Amy smiles, realizes) 
<P ID="dia">This is tough.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">What?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I bat my eyelashes, toss my head just 
right, and there's this very sexy thing 
I do with my eyes - then realize none of 
it matters to you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">It doesn't matter. 
Tell me what you look like.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I.. .1 don't know I'm...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Wait. Let me.


</p><p><p ID="act">He puts his hand out, over her face -- hesitates, then slowly feels 
down the contours of her cheek, her eyelids, the shape of her lips - 
Amy moving with the touch, the sensuality of it - and as he 
continues - Amy's hand reaches up - touching his face - Virgil 
smiles. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Eyes, mouth, chin, cheek.. 
you are very beautiful.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Thank-you. So are you - more than 
I could describe.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil's hands move down her face - closing her eyes - letting her 
just experience his touch - his exploring. 

</p><p><p ID="act">And as both their hands continue, enjoying the sensation of 
discovering each other - Amy leans forward, her eyes still closed, 
finding his mouth - grazing his lips with her own - softly, gently, 
then they fold into each other's arms locked into a warm, deep kiss. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. VIRGIL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

</p><p><p ID="act">It's dark - a pale moonglow highlights the two intertwined naked 
bodies. A fire burns in the background. In flowing CUTS we see them 
make love: 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil - his head tilted down - Amy - puts her hand to his chin - 
lifts his head - then kisses each of his closed eyelids in rhythm 
with Virgil's movements. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy - now astride Virgil - she closes her eyes - feels it the way 
Virgil would - moving faster now - in total rhythm - shuddering in 
mutual release -- and she collapses on top of him - a deep breath 
and she rolls over - cuddles into his arm. 

</p><p><p ID="act">A long beat - out of breath: 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">So -- that's what a blind date is.


</p><p><p ID="act">They breathe - then both start laughing - quietly - then 
hysterically together as Virgil wraps her up in his arms - holding 
her tightly.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EARLY MORNING Sounds of a shower in the 
background. Amy in Virgil's robe, pulls a juice container out of the 
fridge - pours herself a glass, putting the juice on the counter as 
she walks into the living room - taking in the sparseness of his 
surroundings. 

</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE ON - an open Braille Book. The completely white pages with 
minute bumps. Amy pulls up a chair, sits - and flips through the 
book, running her hand across the pages - trying to understand his 
world. 

</p><p><p ID="act">She then turns to the front cover to see what it is. Playboy. 

</p><p><p ID="act">We hear the shower stop as Amy smiles, puts the book down - pushes 
the chair aside then moves to a series of pictures on the wall: 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil as a young boy - his sister Jennie a few years older - and 
his mother and father. Then another picture next to it - Virgil in 
his skates and Jennie older - no father - Sophie at their feet. 

</p><p><p ID="act">And a final picture - Virgil as an adult - he and Jennie on the 
front porch - his arms wrapped around his sister like he's never 
going to let go. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VOICE (O.S.)

</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie moves towards the kitchen. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">I'm Jennie, Virgil's sister.

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil steps out - bathrobe - drying his hair. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Jen, this is Amy Tremont.


</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie now at the kitchen - stares at the juice container - places 
it back in the fridge - just so. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">I was just at the market Virgil, 
picking up a few things before

<P ID="dia">Apples and bananas.
Amy sees the fruit on the counter - impressed. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE

<P ID="spkdir">(putting them in the fridge)

<P ID="dia">Goddamit, Jennie - I said I was OK 
- leave me alone!


</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie hesitates, then stands to go - sees the hockey book out of 
place. A glance to Amy and she picks it up - quietly moves it back 
to it's rightful spot. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">She seemed ... nice.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">She seemed jealous.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Your leg is still bleeding.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">It'll stop - happens all the time.

We hold on Amy - taking this in: 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. BEAR MTN. - LATER THAT NIGHT 

</p><p><p ID="act">Japanese lanterns criss-cross across an open area. Guests of the spa 
mingle about - drinks in hand - some dance on a floor set up over 
the aerobics area. Music plays in the background. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy, carrying two trays of food, finds her way to where Virgil sits 
at a table off to the side - putting his food in front of him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Let's see if I can get this right. 
Chicken's at three - salad at seven - 
vegetables at ten.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

<P ID="dia">Very good - thank-you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">This is nice. 
They do this every weekend?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

come back.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="spkdir">(sits, uneasy) 
<P ID="dia">Love the music - 
Gershwin - makes you want to...


</p><p><p ID="act">She stops. Virgil, fork poised over his food, senses her 
uncomfortableness. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You like dancing?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Hmmm? Yeah - don't do it much. 
<P ID="spkdir">(changing subject) 
<P ID="dia">Chicken's good.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy resumes eating - Virgil's fork spears something on his plate - 
raising it to his mouth - both we and Amy now see it's a large pat 
of butter. Too late - it's in his mouth. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy watches him - the reaction on his face as he tastes it - then 
surreptitiously swallows it. Then realizes Amy saw him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Nothing like a good pat of fat. 
What do you say we dance?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">No, really, I'm fine...


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil is up - pulling her hand. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Come on


</p><p><p ID="act">She stands and Virgil puts his hands on the back of her shoulders. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Lead on.


</p><p><p ID="act">And as she ushers him to the floor the music changes - a salsa - 
lively. Amy stops: 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Different piece - maybe we should...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You kidding - take my hand.


</p><p><p ID="act">And as she does - Virgil starts dancing to the music - feeling the 
beat - in perfect rhythm but his moves are his own, something we've 
never seen before - uninhibited, wild - a little funny, but also 
there's something sensual in his abandonment. 

</p><p><p ID="act">All Amy can do is hang on for the ride - enjoying Virgil enjoying 
himself. People even clear back a little to give him some room - 
however he moves about the floor easily - somehow sensing where the 
other couples are. 

</p><p><p ID="act">It's a whirlwind moment - a moment where the two of them get lost 
with each other - for a second shutting out the world and it's just 
them, the music and their movement. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Then suddenly the music is over. And they stop - the moment gone. 
Virgil turns to Amy and she applauds Virgil's wild moves 

</p><p><p ID="act">He takes a bow with a flourish. Spins to another angle - another 
bow. Spins back again - a step back and: 

</p><p><p ID="act">CRASSSH - he's into the buffet table - sliding to the ground - food 
spilling on top of him. Amy, can't help but laugh, rushes to him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">You have to teach me that move.


</p><p><p ID="act">And Amy reaches down to his guacamole covered hand - and pulls him 
up into an embrace and as they kiss amidst sauce and salad dressing

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I prefer to think of it as not winning.
I thought you would have been long gone

<P ID="dia">Amy, you see the big tree outside? 
How far is it from my front porch?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Guessing, about thirty feet.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">To you. But to me, it's fourteen steps exactly. 
Fourteen steps and I arrive right where I want 
to be. But -- if I run or rush, I'll lose count 
and slam into it.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry. Told you - can't leave well enough 
alone. I - I guess I should get back, start to pack...

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Ordinary? 
<P ID="spkdir">(she laughs) 
<P ID="dia">It's an acquired taste - trust me. 
Jennie thinks it's the only way I'll

<P ID="spkdir">(holds up a little bottle) 
<P ID="dia">Hot sauce! Let's you know you're eating 
something - like some.


</p><p><p ID="act">He starts to sprinkle liberally on Amy's food. Amy, laughing grabs 
the bottle. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">That's OK - I'll do it. 
Don't want to overdo it.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy closes her eyes - takes in the scent - and they both sit there -

<P ID="dia">Virgil, before you lost all sight, 
do you remember seeing anything at all? 


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Yeah, I do. I was just a baby when it 
happened - but there is one thing. 
<P ID="spkdir">(beat) 
<P ID="dia">Something ... puffy. That's all I 
remember about it. Everyone says it's 
"clouds," but I know I had it in my hands

it's stayed with me all these years - 
I don't know why.


</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">DR. RICHARD AARON, wire rims, short, stylish haircut - is finishing 
a high-tech examination of Virgil's eyes. Cups attached to wires sit 
over his eyes. The machine, an ELECTRORETINOGRAM, emits an 
irritating strange flat line sound. The room is very dimly lit. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Aaron adjusts an intensity dial on the machine - a series of 
flashing lights hit Virgil's eyes. The doctor jots down a reading - 
then with a flourish, spins the machine away from Virgil's face and 
pops a button emitting a detailed computer print out. 

</p><p><p ID="act">In the corner sits an older gentleman - Dr. Goldman - focused on 
papers in his hands. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">OK - we're done.


</p><p><p ID="act">Aaron bumps up the lights and wheels his chair back over to Virgil 
as Amy moves to join them. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Some good news. You have grade 4 
posterior subscapular cataracts.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">And this is the good news?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON
<P ID="dia">Good news in that I should be able to 
remove them with little or no damage 
to your cornea.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">So -- what does that mean - 
they're gone - then what?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">The cataracts are acting like a curtain - 
covering the window of sight. If the disease 
to the retina is reduced as much as I think 
it is - there's a very good possibility 
we can give you sight.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy looks to Virgil - apprehensive. Virgil's expressionless - taking 
this all in. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Sounds expensive.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="spkdir">(looks to Goldman who nods imperceptibly) 
<P ID="dia">We feel there's an opportunity for us all here - 
I think I can get the institute to pick up the bill.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">So. Say you remove the cataracts - 
do you have any idea what kind of vision I'd have?


</p><p><p ID="act">Aaron looks to Goldman. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">At this time - no. Unfortunately the 
cataracts are not allowing me to see the 
retinal wall. I can't tell how advanced 
the retinitas pigmentosa has become.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">So you're suggesting an operation 
that may or may not be successful.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">But there is a chance he 
could regain his sight.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">There have been a few cases of restored 
vision in adulthood to a patient blind since birth. 
<P ID="spkdir">(moves near Virgil) 
<P ID="dia">The operation is delicate, I'll admit - 
but nothing as invasive as what you went 
through as a child. Of course there is 
always some risks with any operation - 
infection, swelling - long shot stuff. 
I would do both eyes at the same time 
- it's basically out patient surgery.
Virgil - an exhale of air. A lot to take in. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">What if it doesn't work? What if I have 
the operation - with all it's risks - 
and you remove the cataract - and it doesn't work.


</p><p><p ID="act">Aaron looks to Amy. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="spkdir">(somber) 
<P ID="dia">It would be evident that you will 
never be able to see.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil's head shifts slightly. Not what he wanted to hear. Amy 
reaches out takes his hand. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">What do you think?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">That's what I need - to think.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">This is my place - there's a park

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">My art school days - not very good.

stopping during the dialogue. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">It's a mother? - holding her child - up in the air 
- like she's proud? It's beautiful.

I could use some air.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="spkdir">(moving to the windows) 
<P ID="dia">I think so.


</p><p><p ID="act">As Amy throws open the window, a wind blasts through - catching a

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Damn!


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil turns, concerned, makes his way to her.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">The wind - knocked over my plans.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy down on the floor picking them up - Virgil senses her down there 
- crouches down beside her - tries to help her pick up. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">What is this - these plans?


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy looks at Virgil - - his hand running across one of her plans. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Just my work - - some plans for the Atlanta

we're finishing up, some other smaller stuff. 
It's -- it's what I do.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy realizes they mean nothing to him - he hands them back - stands. 
She watches him - then standing, moves to him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

<P ID="dia">Alright. A movie. I won't be long.


</p><p><p ID="act">And Amy gives him a quick kiss and dodges for the door - a beat - 
she forgets her purse - steps back in to see:

feeling the paper - searching for the design - wanting to know her -

</p><p><p ID="act">We see Amy, coffee cup in hand, grab a second just poured cup out of 
a vending machine. She makes her way over to reveal Jennie who sits 
quietly reading a book. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Coffee? It's really bad. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie looks up - smiles takes the cup. Amy sits down next to her. 
They both sip for a moment.

<P ID="dia">Virgil never mentions his parents 
- do they know? 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE

even a teenager. And our father - he's been 
gone for quite awhile. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry. I didn't know.

<P ID="dia">You're right this is bad.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. AARON 
<P ID="dia">There you are.


</p><p><p ID="act">And Aaron pulls out the cloudy cataract tissue - holding it up for 
all to see - before he PLOPS it on a tray. Switching instruments - 
he gingerly picks up a plastic implant - moving back towards the eye 
- he glances at the nurse assisting him: 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. AARON 
<P ID="dia">You know what they say, Virgil? 
The eyes are the windows to the soul.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

I see myself to be a bad hair day. 
<P ID="spkdir">(Virgil reacts to a sound) 
<P ID="dia">What's that?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">There's camera guys here too.


</p><p><p ID="act">WIDE - we now see the room has a small VIDEO CREW in it preparing to

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Camera guys?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="spkdir">(entering) 
<P ID="dia">For posterity. We're going to make you
famous. We're also sending this closed

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Good. Great. Fine. 
<P ID="spkdir">(a laugh) 
<P ID="dia">Nervous.


</p><p><p ID="act">Aaron moves about the room closing blinds to let in just a few slats 
of light. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Nothing to be nervous about. 
Now Jennie and Amy, if you would 
stand off to my right -- I want 
Virgil to get just a slight bounce 
of light.
<P ID="spkdir">(returning to Virgil) 
<P ID="dia">Ready Virgil.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Let's go.


</p><p><p ID="act">Both Amy and Jennie subconsciously adjust their hair as Aaron starts 
to unravel the bandages. 

</p><p><p ID="act">When the bandages are completely off - all that is left are two 
gauze patches on both eyes. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Okay - last phase - 
we remove these patches and...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="spkdir">(suddenly apprehensive, hand up) 
<P ID="dia">Okay - wait. So - so - what do I do? 
I mean, what will I see first?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON
<P ID="dia">Well - we're all here - Amy, 
your sister. This is new for 
us all. Why don't we find out?


</p><p><p ID="act">Aaron reaches up and plucks the two patches from his eyes - and 
everyone waits. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil slowly opens his eyes - he just seems to be staring blankly, 
bewildered - not focusing at Aaron who stands before him, still 
holding the bandages. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy looks to Jennie - to Aaron - what's happening? Then finally: 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Well?


</p><p><p ID="act">And Virgil reacts - a startling look of recognition mixed with fear 
crossing his face. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">What is it Virgil?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">It's - it's - I don't know.


</p><p><p ID="act">And now for the first time we see Virgil's POV: 

</p><p><p ID="act">There is light, movement, color, shadow - but somehow it is foreign 
to us. There is no perception of depth -. no sense of definition of 
shape or shadow - it is as confounding to us as it is to Virgil - 
like an explosion of Picasso, Dali and Monet on screen. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly in the midst of this chaos of images - there is movement - 
and a voice emits out of what we now for the first time recognize as 
a mouth. Dr. Aaron speaks again - leaning in to Virgil, who reacts 
back. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Virgil - what do you see?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Something's wrong.


</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie's reaction comes pouring out of her eyes in tears, first 
slowly, then a dam break. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil what's wrong?
What's happening?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Everything's fine - 
it's going to take...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">It's not fine - 
don't say it's fine.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Tell me what you're seeing Virgil.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil suddenly pulling back - his eyes dancing around in his head - 
trying to take it all in - trying to focus. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="spkdir">(over everyone) 
<P ID="dia">I don't know - it's all screwed up - 
this can't be seeing - something's wrong
- too confusing - what the hell's happening??!


</p><p><p ID="act">HIS POV - the camera crew coming toward him for a closer shot - it's 
like a giant monster violently moving towards us! 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">What is it - Stop!


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil's hand lashes out towards the camera crew - even though they 
are 15 feet away. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">What? The camera?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="spkdir">(to the crew) 
<P ID="dia">Stop moving!


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Virgil, it's just the camera.


</p><p><p ID="act">The room has heightened into chaos - Virgil reacting to everything 
he sees, any quick movement - Amy moves next to him - Aaron trying 
to remain calm - Jennie assuring Virgil everything's OK. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Alright - alright - they've stopped. 
OK. Let's everybody just calm down 
- we'll take it slowly.


</p><p><p ID="act">Everyone settles - takes a breath. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil. What can we do?


</p><p><p ID="act">They all look to Virgil - breathing heavy - his eyes swinging back 
and forth. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I gotta focus - gotta think - 
gimme a second - OK, OK - get me a 
coke. Somebody?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">He's thirsty - someone get him a drink!!


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">No - just a can - a bottle -- 
put something in my hands!


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy reaches over - grabs an empty coke can. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Here - how's this?


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil takes it in his hands - closes his eyes - feels it. Then 
slowly opens his eyes - trying to focus on what is in his hand - 
Aaron catching on. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Good, Virgil - that's it - use your touch - 
associate - now, tell me - what do you see 
in your hand?


</p><p><p ID="act">Long moment. Virgil holds it up - stares hard. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">A can. Is it a can?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">What's going on?


</p><p><p ID="act">They all look at Virgil turning the can over and over in his hand - 
staring intently at it - learning it. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="spkdir">(beams) 
<P ID="dia">He's associating - one sense to the other. 
His fingers tell his brain - then his brain 
tells his eyes and he recognizes the image 
in front of him. 
<P ID="spkdir">(realizing) 
<P ID="dia">He's seeing!


</p><p><p ID="act">Aaron looks to Amy and Jennie - they're still doubtful - he motions 
to them to meet him outside. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">Virgil - let's rest your eyes for today and 
we'll check them again tomorrow. We should
all be happy - we've got something.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil: not happy, just very confused. As Aaron leaves, Jennie takes 
Virgil's hand while Amy stands there upset - watching him just 
staring at a Soda Can. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">In the corridor, Dr. Aaron shaking hands with Dr. Goldman - people 
exiting the near-by conference room all congratulating the two 
doctors. As Amy exits the room - Aaron moves to her. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">What just happened in there?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">You saw it. Success.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Success - wait a minute - then why can't 
he see me, his sister, anything.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON
<P ID="dia">He sees you. He just doesn't 
understand that he sees you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">But he'll overcome it - I mean - 
this is temporary right?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">There's a very real possibility the 
part of his brain area allocated to 
vision is atrophied - given it's lack 
of use, Virgil has probably used it 
for some other function.


</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie has stepped into the waiting area - has just heard Aaron. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">You didn't think of this?


</p><p><p ID="act">This is as much an accusation of Amy as of Aaron. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON 
<P ID="dia">We had no way of knowing what his faculties 
were until we gave him the operation. If you 
remember - we didn't know what to expect 
- though it's clear his retinal disease must 
be in remission.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">So what are we supposed to do now - 
you saw him - it's like he's another 
person in there.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON
<P ID="dia">He won't need to stay here - take him home 
- let him rest. But I will need to see him 
every couple of days for the next month. 


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Isn't there some kind of therapy 
he should be doing - someone to help him.


</p><p><p ID="act">Aaron stares at her - hadn't thought of this. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON
<P ID="dia">OK, there is a visual therapist - Ray Webster 
- a little unorthodox - that's why he's probably 
your best bet, especially considering the unique 
aspects of Virgil's condition. I'll contact 
him for you - but there's no guarantee he can help.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="spkdir">(can't believe this) 
<P ID="dia">No guarantees.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AARON
<P ID="dia">Jennie, I told Amy here when we first talked - this is whole 
new ground - for all of us.


</p><p><p ID="act">And Jennie quietly turns and goes back into Virgil's room. Amy just 
stares at Dr. Aaron - a little overwhelmed. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CHANGE AREA - DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil - starting to dress. He stares at his clothes on a hangar - 
not comprehending what it is. He closes his eyes - his hand going 
out to feel it - then opening his eyes - he takes the shirt turns - 
and notices someone watching him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Hello?


</p><p><p ID="act">HIS POV - it's his own reflection in a mirror next to his clothes. 
Virgil stares at himself standing stock still - waiting for a 
response from the person staring at him. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Is there...?


</p><p><p ID="act">Slowly realizing that what he sees is himself. He starts moving 
towards the mirror fascinated. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil's POV - Focusing on the image as it slowly takes shape - 
becomes clearer to him. His hand going up to his nose - moving it 
back and forth - laughs at it's absurdity - then is taken with his 
own smile. He tries a smile - comes off awkward as he starts to 
stare at his teeth. Touching each part of his face he investigates 
his chin, ears and finally his hair. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Then he stops - and just stares - and stares at a face that is his 
own - but so incredibly foreign to him. Who is this person? 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. VIRGIL'S ROOM - DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Jenny starting to pack up Virgil's things. Suddenly there is a burst

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">No - it's Jennie.


</p><p><p ID="act">She moves toward him - Virgil pulls back - hands out in front of 
him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry - I'll move slower - I just...


</p><p><p ID="act">And Virgil's hands are on her face - eyes closed - feeling. He opens

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE
<P ID="dia">But I can't stay here - and you can't

</p><p><p ID="act">She stops. Realizing. 

</p><p><p ID="act">ANGLE On Amy - outside the door - not wanting to go in. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">Amy? She's going to look after you? 
She doesn't know anything about the blind.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

<P ID="dia">You alright? 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE

<P ID="spkdir">(turns to her) 
<P ID="dia">Don't expect him to reach out when he's in pain,

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">This is just great - I don't believe this. 
What's that saying - stop the world I wanna get off.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHAN (O.S.) 
<P ID="dia">Hey Virgil, it's Ethan.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil turns to the familiar voice. Ethan, basketball under his arm, 
coming out of the building with his Mom, KAREN COLVIN. Virgil scans, 
tries to focus on them. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">That you Ethan?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHAN 
<P ID="dia">It's me - and this is my mom.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

in your apartment.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy laughs - pulls him into the room. Virgil trying to take it all 
in - not understanding anything. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I wanted to do something 
special for you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">It's making me a little

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil's hands go out - Amy moves to him - he holds her shoulders. 
He stares at her. 

</p><p><p ID="act">As she turns her head slightly, Virgil is able to focus on her - her 
eyes - her smile. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Okay - so - this is what 
beautiful looks like.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Thank-you. You want to
see the rest.
Focusing on her, Virgil smiles, takes her face in his hands - leans 
in and kisses her. She pulls back a little. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I can't believe this 
- how nervous I am.


</p><p><p ID="act">She kisses him then takes a step back. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">What if you don't like what you see?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Do you want me to turn off the lights?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">No - no. This is your first seeing day. 
<P ID="spkdir">(she starts to unbutton her dress) 
<P ID="dia">I want you to see everything.


</p><p><p ID="act">And she drops the dress from her shoulders - it hits the ground - a

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">OK?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Yes, very OK.

</p><p><p ID="act">The sound of heavy New York rain. Amy awakening, and sees Virgil is 
gone, his side of the bed empty. She looks across the room - where

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You enjoy sculpting?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">At first. I liked the idea of molding -

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">But you never finish them.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Pieces never come out the way I wanted

never getting them right.

I thought you were going to help me here.


</p><p><p ID="act">Webster rummages in his desk - pulls out a magazine photo - then 
digging in a brown paper bag - he pulls out an apple. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WEBSTER 
<P ID="dia">You want a lesson? Right - here. 
What's this?


</p><p><p ID="act">He holds out the apple for Virgil - who reluctantly takes it - holds 
it in his hand, eyes closed, feels it - then opening his eyes he 
holds it out in front of him, trying to focus on it. 

</p><p><p ID="act">HIS POV - as the apple slowly takes on dimension and shape. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

<P ID="dia">Good. Good. 
<P ID="spkdir">(holding up the photo) 
<P ID="dia">OK. What's this now?


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil stares at the photo. HIS POV - a photo of -- an APPLE. Not 
that different from the real apple he holds in his hand - he holds 
the real apple up to compare - using his eyes. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">It's an apple.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">WEBSTER 
<P ID="spkdir">(holding the paper out to Virgil) 
<P ID="dia">Good. Good. But is it an apple or 
just a picture of an apple?


</p><p><p ID="act">And Virgil feels the paper and suddenly realizes - it's not an apple 
- just a representation of one. Virgil is visibly disappointed. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">So this is a joke? Is that what you're
saying - your eyes lie to you? Great 
- looking forward to this.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">WEBSTER 
<P ID="dia">Your eyesight can and will play tricks on 
you Virgil. Remember that. No matter what
I could teach you - no matter what exercises 
I could give you - they'll still play tricks on you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">That's all it is right now - one big trick. 
Nothing makes any sense. I can't function like this.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">WEBSTER
<P ID="spkdir">(he moves to his chair) 
<P ID="dia">Virgil - look - you have to learn to see - 
just like you learned to speak. Only this 
is not like learning a new language - 
it's like learning language for the first time. 
<P ID="spkdir">(he leans forward) 
<P ID="dia">Perception - sight - life, is about experience 
- about reaching out and exploring the world 
for yourself. It's not enough to just see Virgil -- 
<P ID="spkdir">(he points two fingers into his eyes) 
<P ID="dia">-- we've got to look as well.

<P ID="dia">Well, thank-you Obi Wan Kenobi -

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy just stares. It's clear they're both tired. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I'm just trying to help you see.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I know. But that's all it seems we're 
about. How was your day - what goes on 
at work - how about those Rangers - 
did the stock market hold today - 
is there anything else going on in our 
world besides my eyes?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="spkdir">(beat) 
<P ID="dia">OK, we've been invited to a party 
- Duncan's birthday.


</p><p><p ID="act">An ITALIAN WAITER appears - putting a large plate of spaghetti in 
front of Virgil and Amy. Virgil is a little repulsed by what he 
sees. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">What's this - looks like worms.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">It's spaghetti - it's fine.


</p><p><p ID="act">As Virgil tries to maneuver his fork - Amy reaches behind her. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I brought you a present - 
good for hand eye coordination.


</p><p><p ID="act">She hands him a TOYS R US bag. He peers inside. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Great - you go to work building buildings 
- I go home with building blocks.


</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ROSWELL -TREMONT - LATE DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy - looking a little worn - staring blankly at her computer. A 
three dimensional rendition of the mall rotates on the screen. 
Duncan pokes his head in. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">I'm here for you to wish me 
happy birthday. How's it going?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="spkdir">(distracted) 
<P ID="dia">OK. He's progressing, slowly 
- doing the best he can.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">I was actually wondering about the mall 
designs. We're expected in Atlanta tomorrow 
- with these plans.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I can't go to Atlanta tomorrow 
- not with Virgil's problems,..


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">Ok, ok 
<P ID="spkdir">(Duncan moves in behind her) 
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry. Things aren't going so well?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="spkdir">(stares at her work) 
<P ID="dia">He seems blinder now than he ever was.


</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan puts his hands on her shoulders - starts to knead them. Amy 
starts to relax. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Do you ever wonder why 
you do the things you do?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">Didn't get what you expected did you? 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Sometimes I think he's not going to make it 
- that he's never going to be able to see.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">Amy - listen to me. You liked this guy 
- I saw that. You wanted to help him 
- it didn't work out so hot. You can't 
punish yourself.. Sometimes things just 
don't work out the way we want them to 
- look at us.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy smiles warmly. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Yeah. Thanks Duncan.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">Anytime. 
<P ID="spkdir">(beat, a joke) 
<P ID="dia">Now back to work.


</p><p><p ID="act">As he starts out of the room, Amy turns stops him.

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil sits at the kitchen table staring at everyday kitchen 
utensils - being held by Ethan. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Measuring cup?


</p><p><p ID="act">Ethan shakes his head - no - it's a cheese grater. Virgil stares 
again. Ethan mimes grating cheese. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Cheese grater.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHAN 
<P ID="dia">Yes - my man.


</p><p><p ID="act">Ethan holds up something new - one of those strange spaghetti 
strainers. Now they are both staring at something they don't 
understand. Virgil looks to Ethan. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHAN 
<P ID="dia">Got me.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="spkdir">(laughing) 
<P ID="dia">You're no help. How am I supposed 
to do my homework if...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHAN 
<P ID="dia">Homework - dude - I
ain't doin' homework.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil continues to look at the strainer as Ethan gravitates towards 
his cane folded up on the table. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHAN 
<P ID="spkdir">(beat) 
<P ID="dia">You're lucky you got a cane.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil looks over - sees his fascination. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You want it. I've been thinking
about throwing it out.


</p><p><p ID="act">Ethan's up in a flash. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHAN 
<P ID="dia">Man - really - I can have it? Cool. 
<P ID="spkdir">(picking it up) 
<P ID="dia">I could be a Ninja Darth Vader fighter 
with one of these - protect my mom from 
the evil super.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil is up - with the spaghetti strainer in his hand. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">But first you'll have to fight 
off the evil --- whatever this is.


</p><p><p ID="act">As they joust about - Virgil enjoying himself - there's a knock at 
the door. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Could be the super - go for cover.


</p><p><p ID="act">As Ethan ducks behind the couch, Virgil makes his way to the door, 
fumbling with the handle - he opens it to: 

</p><p><p ID="act">JENNIE. Virgil stares at her. We soon realize he has no idea who 
this is. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Yes?


</p><p><p ID="act">Jenny looks at him, her eyes welling. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">Virgil - it's me.


</p><p><p ID="act">And suddenly Ethan is there - cane drawn like a sword. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHAN 
<P ID="dia">En garde.


</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie startled - looks to Ethan then Virgil. What's going on? 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">Jennie?! Jennie.. God, I'm sorry 
- c'mon in - this is my friend Ethan 
- what are you doing here?


</p><p><p ID="act">Off Jennie's look: 

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil and Jennie standing across the street from a building being 
torn down. Hard hatted WORKERS hover about the large trucks at work. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You want to tell me 
what we're doing here?


</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie points. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">That's him. That's our Father.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil looks in the direction she's pointing - tries to focus on a 
figure moving across the lot. The MAN we saw watching TV. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I can't - I can't see him.


</p><p><p ID="act">Jennie looks to him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">I thought your eyes were better.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">No. I - I don't want to see him. 
My eyes aren't good enough - not yet 
- he won't understand. It won't be enough.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil takes a step back. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JENNIE 
<P ID="dia">He's our father. He heard about the 
operation and he's asked to see you. 
Look here he comes.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">GODDAMIT Jennie - I don't want to 
see him - I don't even know why you
brought me here.


</p><p><p ID="act">And Virgil takes another step back then turns and starts of f down 
the street leaving Jenny alone. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. AMY'S BUILDING - NIGHT 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy making her way up the stairs - roll of plans under her arm. 
Opening her door to: 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT 

</p><p><p ID="act">A totally dark room. She drops her things. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil?... Virgil?!


</p><p><p ID="act">She flicks on the light - to reveal Virgil has been sitting in the 
dark. She looks over - sees the scattered blocks on the floor. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I'm here. I forget about the lights sometimes.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY
<P ID="dia">Look - about this party tonight 
- it's no big deal - maybe we should just...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL
<P ID="dia">It's your partner's birthday. We should go 
- besides you wanted me to meet your friends, right?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Yeah. Right.


</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. LOFT - NIGHT 

</p><p><p ID="act">Noisy, crowded - PEOPLE mill about carrying drinks - black and 
silver balloons float about the ceiling. Moving through the crowd - 
music blasting - Amy introducing people to Virgil over the noise. 

</p><p><p ID="act">A WAITER walks up to them holding a tray of wine. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITER 
<P ID="dia">Glass of wine? Red - white?


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy reaches out - takes one. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Which is the red?


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy looks at the waiter - then points to one. Virgil's hand reaches 
out slowly - hovering - it's clear it's confusing - trying to 
separate out one glass. The Waiter looks to Amy like "is he OK?" 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil - here let me.


</p><p><p ID="act">Her hand darts in front of his. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="spkdir">(quick) 
<P ID="dia">No! Sorry - I mean - I'm almost 
there - I think I got it.


</p><p><p ID="act">And she backs off as his hand wraps around a glass - pulling it 
back. At the last second knocking over two other glasses. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Dammit. Sorry.


</p><p><p ID="act">The Waiter - trying not to spill on himself. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITER 
<P ID="dia">Trust me - you're not the first - 
or probably the last. Let me get a cloth.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Thanks


</p><p><p ID="act">The Waiter smiles - and as he walks off. Virgil nervously takes a 
large drink of wine. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITER 
<P ID="dia">I hope you're driving.


</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly from the front of the room - MARSHALL, the host calls out: 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARSHALL 
<P ID="dia">OK. He's coming up the stairs. 
Everybody get ready - kill the lights.


</p><p><p ID="act">Excitement - a buzz - Virgil looks around then CLICK - all the 
lights go out. Virgil panics momentarily. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">What - what's happening?


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy moves to him in the near dark room. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">It's for the surprise - 
they turned off the lights.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Surprise - yeah.


</p><p><p ID="act">And suddenly the lights flood back on, everyone screams: SURPRISE!! 

</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan - at the door with Betsy - genuinely surprised - catches his 
breath - then fakes a quick heart attack and drops to the floor. 

</p><p><p ID="act">The room explodes in laughter - Amy included. This action is even 
more confusing to Virgil. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Is he OK?


</p><p><p ID="act">Hearing this - everyone breaks into bigger laughter - Virgil now the 
focus of attention - good naturedly laughs - Amy smiles, 
embarrassed. Virgil takes a gulp of his wine, finishing it off. 

</p><p><p ID="act">LATER: 

</p><p><p ID="act">The Music is cranked! Many couples dance. Virgil exits the bathroom 
- glances back in the mirror again, at his hair - not sure he likes 
its style. He tries brushing it to the other side - it's OK. How 
about the other way - not so bad - maybe. It's clear he's a little 
tipsy as he keeps playing with his hair. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITER (O.S.) 
<P ID="dia">Here ya go Virgil.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil turns - the Waiter stands there holding a glass of wine - 
placing it carefully into Virgil's hand: 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Cheers, Kevin.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY (O.S.)
<P ID="spkdir">(over the noise)
<P ID="dia">Virgil!!


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil embarrassed, turns - can faintly hear Amy's voice over the 
music. Searches the room - bopping bodies - balloons being bashed 
round - lights dim. The number of drinks he's had isn't helping. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil--over here!!


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy, standing with Duncan and Betsy. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN
<P ID="dia">Maybe he's blind again.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Don't even think it. C'mon - I want the 
both of you to meet him - he'll never 
find us here.


</p><p><p ID="act">With VIRGIL - smiling as he sees Amy, Duncan and Betsy move towards 
him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil - I'm sorry - I went to get 
Duncan. Duncan - Virgil. And this is 
Betsy.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">Hey Virgil good to meet you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">BETSY 
<P ID="dia">Heard a lot about you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Heyyy! Yeah. Good to meet you.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil thrusts his hand out - colliding it into Duncan's. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Sorry - things still get a 
little cockeyed sometimes.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="spkdir">(holding up his drink) 
<P ID="dia">Few more of these and I'll be the same.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Lemme get Kevin - my man - 
he'll top you up. KE-VIN!!!


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil!


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">What?


</p><p><p ID="act">Uncomfortable - everyone stops. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Nothing. It's ok.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">Amy, in Atlanta tomorrow...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Duncan - I told you...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">I spoke to Falk and he...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="spkdir">(can't hear) 
<P ID="dia">What?


</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan pulls Amy in close to talk - shutting Virgil and Betsy out. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BETSY 
<P ID="dia">Amy said you had great hands. 


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="spkdir">(laughs) 
<P ID="dia">She did, did she.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil holds them up in front of his face - tries to see them. Then 
looks past them and watches Amy and Duncan - more importantly looks 
at Duncan's hair, his clothes. It's clear he's becoming aware of 
appearances. His own especially. 

</p><p><p ID="act">As they break their tete a tete. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BETSY
<P ID="dia">You know my father was blind for several 
years, he had cataracts as well.


</p><p><p ID="act">Somehow this comes out patronizing. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Really. I'm surprised I don't 
know him. It's a club you know.


</p><p><p ID="act">Kevin, the African American waiter comes up. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">KEVIN 
<P ID="dia">Yes.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil throws his arm around Kevin. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Kevin - Duncan here the birthday man 
- could use himself a drink. Kevin here 
tells me he's black - did you know that
- I mean look at him - look at me -
isn't that the damnedest thing. He's black. 


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy is mortified, Kevin laughs. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">KEVIN
<P ID="dia">I'll get you a drink.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil looks to Amy. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">What's that look?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">What look?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I've never seen your face that way 
before. It's.. .weird. What does it mean?


</p><p><p ID="act">Before she can answer - a dance song breaks out - Betsy wraps her 
arm around Duncan's. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BETSY 
<P ID="dia">Come on Duncan - let's dance - 
move those old bones.


</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan only acknowledges Betsy's contact with a raised eyebrow to 
Amy. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">What the hell it's my birthday -- nice to 
meet you Virgil - see you at the opening.


</p><p><p ID="act">And they're gone onto the floor. Virgil watches him - sees the ease 
with which Duncan moves, handles things. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Opening?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">The lobby we designed. Virgil - you can't...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Let's dance.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil takes her arm and pulls her out on the floor. Amy - ready for 
one of Virgil's wild dances takes hold of his hand. The music 
blaring, Virgil starts to get into it - Amy starting to relax - then 
Virgil slowly notices how everyone else is dancing - more 
conservative. 

</p><p><p ID="act">He's even getting some looks from people. Slowly he winds down - 
tries to mimic what everyone else is doing - ends up in just a slow 
shuffle. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy watches him - sees he's uncomfortable - moves to him - but 
Virgil turns on his heel and strides away. Amy follows after him. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. LOFT - CORNER - NIGHT 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil stands near the glass doors leading to an outdoor balcony. 
Amy comes up to him - finds Virgil facing a wall - eyes shut. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">What are you doing?


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil's head cocks slightly towards her - just like when he was 
blind. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I feel like Rip Van Winkle. 
I've woken up from a thirty year sleep 
- and the world's passed me by.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">It's just dancing. Who cares?


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil whirls on her - his hand on her shoulder to steady his look 
at her. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">No-no-no-no. It's not the Goddamn dancing. 
I wanted to come here tonight - show you I
could "fit" in. Like the big boys do. Big 
seeing boys. Yes. Well, I don't. Don't.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">It's just going to take time. 
You weren't ready. We shouldn't have come.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">No - I - me, shouldn't have come. 
You want me to see - but you know what 
- you know what - shit - I don't belong 
in the wonderful world of seeing. 


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy reaches out to him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil x85 look x85.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy realizes what she just said - Virgil pulls his arm away. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">No, I won't. I'm tired of looking. 
Fuck looking and the horse it came in on.


</p><p><p ID="act">And he spins to get away from her and takes a step crashing right 
into the sliding glass door which explodes in a shower of little 
crystals. 

</p><p><p ID="act">The party slams to a halt - Amy stands stunned. Virgil shaken - tiny 
cuts on his face. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Oh my God, are you alright?


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil slams his eyes shut. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Yeah, I'm just fine. Take me home.


</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. AMY'S LOFT - NEXT MORNING 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil, small nicks on his face, wakes up - rolls over - feels the 
empty bed beside him. Looks up to see Amy pulling her coat on - 
suitcase at her side. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Didn't want to wake you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You're going.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

<P ID="dia">What - we're not working - your eyes 
- what's not working?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I get up every morning - I look in the mirror 
- and I stare at a total stranger. I stare and 
I stare - and no matter how hard I look - I

I look at you...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">What? You don't see me?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I saw you better when I was blind.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Well, you're not blind any more. 
I'm sorry if that disappoints you. 
<P ID="spkdir">(beat) 
<P ID="dia">I've got a plane to catch. I'm going 
to go before we say things we don't mean.


</p><p><p ID="act">And she grabs her bag and is out the door. As we hold on Virgil's

across it - he also reads the visual letters - Dr. Ray Webster. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Peering inside - he sees a Lab - full of the NEWLY BLIND - some 
TEENAGERS - a couple of ADULTS - a handful of SEEING IMPAIRED - all 
learning to use a cane. The rapid tapping of their cane like a room 
full of typewriters. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil watches - the Blind working their way around a small obstacle 
course - many of them running into desks, tables - it's tough, 
frustrating work.

<P ID="dia">Virgil, let me explain something here. 
When you were blind - you dealt with things 
one at a time - sequentially right? A wall 
led to a door to a tree to a car. That's 
how you got to what you wanted - right.
<P ID="spkdir">(beat)
<P ID="dia">Seeing people - for better or worse - 
deal with everything all at once - taking in 
the whole picture - which sometimes confuses

I was a 'seeing person'.

Maybe you didn't have the blood vessels

to be honest, I don't know. I wish to God I did.

where do you go - then sees something off screen. His face torn with

his hand on his face - a face he may never see again - and a cloud

something you got from me.

under his breath. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">FATHER 
<P ID="dia">Every morning I woke up and looked at you

unique. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil moves his way about the lobby - looking at it carefully from 
every possible angle - his hand grazing across walls, entranceways - 
desperately committing as much as he can to memory - finally ending 
up in the middle of the room in a final attempt to absorb as much as 
he can. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GUARD (O.S.)

<P ID="dia">This thing


</p><p><p ID="act">The Guard reaches over - hits a switch - and against one section of 
windows a wall of water comes dripping down - causing a shower of 
indoor rain - the sound instantly echoing off of the walls. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil smiles - moves toward it - closing his eyes - listening to 
the indoor rain - really taking in the room having total empathy 
with what Amy has created.

<P ID="dia">That you're going to be there to see it.

</p><p><p ID="act">The lobby is filled with business types, waiters circulating with 
champagne, tiny hors-d'oeuvres. Virgil and Amy enter - standing at

into a performance for Amy. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">Thanks - here's the genius though - 
I just get the gigs. Can I steal her

tell if he's impressed with our work 
or just has gas from the pate.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Go - do your thing.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I'll be right back. There's food 
and drinks down on the floor.


</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan and Amy start down the stairs as Virgil tries to find a safe 
place to stand. His eyesight fading in and out - he looks around - 
decides to negotiate the steps: 

</p><p><p ID="act">He takes one step on the stairs - looks down - is able to see Amy 
with Falk and Duncan, looking up at him - she smiles - he does his 
best - smiles back - lets go of the handrail - takes another step - 
finally reaching the bottom floor. 

</p><p><p ID="act">He stands there for a long moment - lost as to where to move. A 
glimpse towards the rain sculpture and he starts towards it using 
the sound to help guide him. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Amy looks over - sees Virgil moving across the floor - gives him a 
little wave - he doesn't notice her. 

</p><p><p ID="act">At the rain Virgil stands taking in the sound. A FIGURE comes up 
next to him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Quite a party. Love the detail of the building.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">WEBSTER

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WEBSTER

Any help you can give us with our project?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">I'm a little biased but I kind of

</p><p><P ID="speaker">FALK 
<P ID="dia">Good, I like that attitude. 
Let's keep trying for perfection.


</p><p><p ID="act">Everyone smiles - Amy wraps her arm around Virgil. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">That's right - that's 
why I've got Virgil.


</p><p><p ID="act">Pleasant laughter all around - and as Amy and the others continue - 
we push in on Virgil as he takes in this thought. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil and Amy out front. People leaving - Duncan getting into a

<P ID="spkdir">(beat) 
<P ID="dia">You know I've been thinking - you're doing

<P ID="dia">A seeing celebration?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Yeah, maybe in a couple of months. 
I looked into Egypt - we could see

together for the first time. 
What do you say?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">You know - there is something

<P ID="dia">Of course, anything.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">The Rangers play tomorrow. Season'll

</p><p><p ID="act">BLACK 

</p><p><p ID="act">Then a tiny pinpoint of light ahead - one that grows increasingly 
larger as we move towards a SOUND. A hum that grows in intensity 
until the light fills the frame and BAM - we exit the tunnel and we 
are: 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT 

</p><p><p ID="act">That glorious first view - people - the white ice shining below like 
a giant jewel- and the players - in bright colors scurrying about 
the playing surface below. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">This is amazing - isn't it?


</p><p><p ID="act">She looks to Virgil who is awed by what he is seeing. Then suddenly 
on his face - a flash - one of those moments of darkness. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Should we find our seats. Looks 
like the game's already started.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Amy - the game...


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Right - the game.


</p><p><p ID="act">SMASH - a hard check into the boards deep in the Rangers end of the 
ice. The puck squirts out Gretzky picks it up - fires it across ice 
- one, two it's back to him and he has a wide open break from center 
ice - the crowd is out of their seats - Virgil included - Amy 
quickly getting caught up in the enthusiasm. 

</p><p><p ID="act">On Virgil's face - watching Gretzky skate towards him - excited - 
then losing him - another flash of blackness - like a blow to the 
head - and we hear the crowd suddenly explode - and as Virgil's 
vision regains we see the players mobbing Wayne after his goal - the 
little red light behind the net the only evidence of it happening. 

</p><p><p ID="act">We see the frustration as Virgil realizes he'll never see it. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">He scored, he scored - you see 
that - it was amazing.


</p><p><p ID="act">As the players make their way to center ice - the crowd sits and Amy

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Yeah - it was great - I was just...


</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly Virgil becomes transfixed. Walking down the aisle, away 
from him: 

</p><p><p ID="act">A VENDOR - carrying a tray of PINK COTTON CANDY. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil stares at it a moment - transfixed - then like in a trance - 
he stands - stepping out into the aisle - a man on a mission. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Virgil, where are you going?


</p><p><p ID="act">And he's on the stairs - carefully moving down the stairs toward the 
vendor. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Then she sees the Vendor - handing Virgil a large cotton candy - 
round and puffy like a cloud - but something he can hold in his 
hand. Amy can't believe it - watching Virgil - his fascination at 
finding this long lost memory.

functional. He realizes this is a home designed by his sister. 

</p><p><p ID="act">He moves over to the photo of the family. He on his dad's shoulders.

in but now seems so foreign. Virgil seems oddly disturbed by what he 
sees. 

</p><p><p ID="act">The yellow bus drives by - full of kids - Carl at the helm. Somehow

out and runs along the drawings. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. PINECREST - END OF MAIN STREET - DAY

trees - one lover choosing between two others. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. FIREHOUSE - LATE DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil - stands in the middle of the room. Looks about at what was 
at one time so special to him. Now it just seems old and dingy - the

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. LIBRARY - SUNSET 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil now sits at a table. Stacks and stacks of LIFE magazine 
splayed out in front of him. He is flipping through them at a rapid 
rate - like a drowning man searching for air. 

</p><p><p ID="act">IMAGES - cars, JFK, the pyramids, Martin Luther King, houses, 
flowers, Marilyn Monroe, that Napalm burned little girl in Viet Nam, 
African masks, Dachau prisoners, Nixon, Warhol paintings, the Mona 
Lisa, that vulture watching over the little baby, the Eiffel tower, 
First Man on the moon, the Venus De Milo, that guy in front of the 
tank in Tianaman square .. and the Pyramids. 

</p><p><p ID="act">The pictures go by fast and furious - Virgil soaking them up like a 
sponge - life, beauty, horror, great people, great events... 

</p><p><p ID="act">And we move in on his face - absorbing these images for the last 
time - a face filled with anguish at a world disappearing. And we 
cut to:

</p><p><p ID="act">Golden rays of the late afternoon sun. Amy on the roof - leaning on 
the parapet - watching the horizon. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Then a thought comes to her. And mimicking what Virgil had done - 
she walks back to the other end of the roof, turns and looks out 
towards the skyline again ... then starts slowly walking towards the 
parapet till she reaches the wall again. 

</p><p><p ID="act">The reaction on her face - she doesn't "see" it - not like Virgil 
did. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - DAY 

</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil is shifting furniture in his house. A table - moves it to the

it. 

</p><p><p ID="act">HIS POV - a moment of clear - then haze - then dark - then haze.

and exhausting for him.

<P ID="spkdir">(beat) 
<P ID="dia">I rushed, didn't I? Fourteen steps 
to the tree and I made us smash 
right into it.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">We tried.


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy sits next to him. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">I finished the sculpture. 
I'd love you to see it.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Figure of speech.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Figure of speech. Virgil - when I 
first met you - you saw more than 
any sighted person I've ever known. 
I didn't mean to take that away from you.


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">Amy. I saw ... I actually saw 
the horizon. You did that for me. 
It's out there. You showed me you 
just have to reach for it..


</p><p><p ID="act">Amy smiles - her hand goes out - hesitates - then lands lightly on 
his. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">You want to walk?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">VIRGIL 
<P ID="dia">See what we see?


</p><p><P ID="speaker">AMY 
<P ID="dia">Yeah. Just see what we see.


</p><p><p ID="act">Virgil smiles, nods. As he stands - he takes her arm - and as they 
walk off into the park, we slowly FADE to BLACK and just LISTEN, 
listen to the SOUNDS of the day - the percussion of the city. 

</p><p><p ID="act">THE END
