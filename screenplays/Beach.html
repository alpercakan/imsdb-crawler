</b><I><P>A single headlamp in close up shines directly and brightly out</P>
<P>Extreme noise and light.</P>
<P>Beyond its glare can be seen the outline of a motorized tricycle ("tuk-tud") and its Thai driver</P>
<P>A young man, Richard, sits in the back, his rucksack beside him, swaying with the motion of the vehicle. He is worn and sweating.</P>
<P>They travel through nocturnal Bangkok: fleets of tuk-tuks, taxis, road works, food vendors, dogs, tourists.</P>
<P>Music and credits.</P>

</b><P>When you hit Bangkok, there's really only one place to go.</P>
<I><P>The street is busy, full of Thai's and travelers.</P>
<P>Richard picks his way through the crowd, his rucksack on his back.</P>
<P>He absorbs the scene as he passes boarding houses and hotels, and the shops and stalls selling food, clothes, pirated tapes, jewelry, travel tickets, and international phone calls. Restaurantes are filled with western travelers watching American films or European sport.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>(continuing)</P>
<P>The Khao San Road is a decompression chamber between east and west. It's where you learn to breathe car fumes and tropical air for the very first time, or else carefully rearrange your memories before you catch your flight home.</P>
<I><P>Richard is approached by a young male Thai Hustler who walks backwards in front of him while making his pitch.</P>
<b></I><B><P>HUSTLER</P>
</b></B><P>You need somewhere to stay?</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD </P>
</b></B><P>I'll be OK, Thanks.</P>
<I><P>Richard politely ignores each of his subsequent offers.</P>
<b></I><B><P>HUSTLER</P>
</b></B><P>What do you want? Sell your passport? Buy passport? Airline tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? You get a suit in twenty-four hours. Diamonds? You want to come with me, you get present for your girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem. You want to drink some snake blood?</P>
<I><P>At this last one Richard stops and addresses the Hustler.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>No thanks.</P>
<I><P>Richard walks on, the hustler fading out behind him.</P>
<b></I><B><P>HUSTLER</P>
</b></B><P>You want designer clothes? I get you Versache, Gucci, Armani, no problem. You want a camera, all the best makes: Nikon, Leica, Canon I can get you.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)t</P>
</b><P>Yeah, it's all here: you an phone home, meet up with strangers, split up with your friends, watch Hollywood movies while you sip Budweiser and eat a burger or get some massage and green chicken soup. You could be anywhere in the world bu you could only find it here. And what do they want, all these people?</P></OL>

<I><P>Richard turns into one of the restaurants.</P></OL>

<b><OL START=4>
</b><b></I><LI>INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.</LI>
</b><I><P>The restaurant extends deeply back away from the street. Richard passes many diners not dissimilar to himself. Some are talking, many are engrossed in the video entertainment.</P>
<P>At the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops his pack.</P>
<P>A Thai female HOTEL RECEPTIONIST sits behind the desk. She immediately shows Richard a "menu" of available rooms. The menu offers a spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom.</P>
<P>Richard points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 baht.</P>
<P>The Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at.</P>
<P>A worn, disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the nearby bar, a bottle in his hand, studying Richard. This is Daffy.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Good evening.</P>
<I><P>Daffy says nothing but continues to stare and takes a drink.</P>
<P>Richard will not be stared down. Neither turns away.</P>
<P>The Receptionist passes over a key and smiles broadly.</P>
<b></I><B><P>HOTEL RECEPTIONIST</P>
</b></B><P>Welcome to Thailand.</P>
<I><P>Richard turns to her.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>

<b><OL START=6>
</b><b></I><LI>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT</LI>
</b><I><P>The sound of the shower can be heard through a door marked with a shower sign.</P>
<P>The sound stops and the door is opened. Richard emerges with a towel wrapped around his waist, carrying his key and washbag.</P>
<P>He walks the short distance to his room. He puts the key in the door but the lock is stiff and he has to fiddle with it, bent over and dripping water on the floor.</P>
<P>While he is doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby stairs can be heard.</P>
<P>There is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle.</P>
<P>Richard turns to the source of the whistle.</P>
<P>A beautiful European woman is smiling at him. This is Francoise. She approaches and takes the key from his hand. She turns the key in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle.</P>
<b></I><P>FRANCOIS</P>
</b><P>Et voila.</P>
<I><P>The door swings gently open. She stands back</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Thank you.</P>
<I><P>Footsteps approach from the stair.</P>
<P>Francoise is joined by a young man, ETIENNE, who catches up with her. He nods at Richard as he takes her arm. They walk away from Richard to the next door.</P>
<b></I><B><P>FRANCOISE</P>
</b></B><P>Bonsoir.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>Eh - bonsoir.</P>
<b><B><P>ETIENNE</P>
</b></B><P>Goodnight.</P>
<I><P>The couple reach their door. They enter their room and the door is closed behind them.</P>
<P>Alone in the corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence.</P>
<b></I><B><P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b><P>I was traveling alone for two reasons. First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me.</P></OL>

<b><OL START=7>
</b><b><LI>INT RESTAURANT. NIGHT</LI>
</b><I><P>Richard is in the restaurant which is quiet now.</P>
<P>He is alone at a table eating and drinking. On a high shelf several feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car chases, and explosions, plays on the television.</P>
<P>Most of the tables around him are empty.</P>
<P>Richard is interrupted by the man he met earlier, Daffy, who pulls up a chair beside him.</P>

<b><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.</P>
<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>
</b></B><P>I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.</P>

</b></B><P>I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.</P>
<I><P>Daffy retreats.</P>
<P>Richard turns back to the video and his food.</P>
<P>Daffy approaches two young women sitting at a nearby table.</P>
<b></I><B><P>DAFFY</P>
</b></B><P>Excuse me, ladies, is there any chance you could help me out. I'm down on my luck at the moment.</P>
<I><P>The two young women seem uncomfortable. Richard notices.</P>

<b><B><P>RICHARD</P>

<P>Richard lies on his bed, watching the fan rotate above him.</P>
<P>He is listening to the sound of Etienne and Francoise engaging in noisy sex. They reach the climax of their activity and fall silent.</P>
<P>Richard just has time to enjoy the silence when a new disturbance begins, this time from the next room in the other</I> <I>direction. It is a man, Daffy, banging on the wall just above Richard's head and shouting in time.</P>

</b></B><P>Wicketkeeper. First slip. Second slip. Gully. Square leg. Long leg. Silly mid-off. Cover point.</P>
<I><P>At low tide, two sets of cricket stumps have been set up on the beach some twenty yards apart. The stumps and bats have been roughly hewn.</P>
<P>At one end, Sten stands with a bat, ready to defend his stumps. At the other end stands Keaty, who is umpiring. Behind them, the bowler warms up, holding a small rubber ball.</P>
<P>Among the ten fielders are Etienne and Francoise.</P>
<P>Richard, the second batsman, walks toward Keaty, practicing with an air of exuberance.</P>
<b></I><B><P>KEATY</B> </P>
</b><P>(Continuing)</P>
<P>We thank you Lord, for the twin pillars of civilization, Christianity and cricket, even when played by those of another faith., Amen. Ok, right arm over the wicket; first ball.</P>
<I><P>The bowler runs up and bowls. Sten hits the ball and it is fielded for no run at leaisurly pace by Etienne. Keaty and Richard watch.</P>

<b><B><P>KEATY</P>
</b></B><P>That is why you killed it, isn't it? Ducked one way then the other! All to impress her, I suppose.</P>
<I><P>The second ball is bowled and fielded.</P>

</b>  <P>And the next day, we couldn't meet up either. It was straight back up. Same 
  scene again: no travelers, no boat, no action, nothing. Now I thought if this 
  is going to be a regulra situation, I'm going to have to start hiding from Sal 
  so I don't have to come up here. But a strange thing happened: I began to 
  enjoy it. I looked forward to it, I started to explore.</P></LI></OL>
<OL start=115>
<b>  <LI>EXT. HILL. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>From a vantage point, Richard looks down on the lagoon, the beach, the

  <P>With the binoculars he can see the details of life in each of these 
  areas.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY. <I>

  Francoise, Etienne, Sal, Bugs, Keaty, etc.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>And then I couldn't understand why I'd never come up before. I got a whole 
  new perspective. They were ants, or rats in an experiment, but up here I 
  wasn't part of it, I was free. I could do whatever I wanted. This was my 
  personal adventure playground. There was even a bunch of local bad guys I 
  could fool around with.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Looking through the trees, the four dope farmers (with their guns) are 
  visible about thirty meters away, relaxing and playing cards.</P>
  <P>Richard appears in a tree, hiding from their view, if they cared to 
  look.</P>
  <P>He steals forward to another tree. He watches them.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>Pretty soon, I was starring in my very own war movie. It was Vietnam 1968, 
  or at least about as close to it as I would ever get, considering I was born 
  in 1973. But I knew exactly who I was: renegade special forces officer on a 
  solo mission, search and destroy. I liked the sound of it "he prefers to work 
  alone," they'd say, "he's got the stare."</P><I>
  <P>The farmers are oblivious.</P>
  <P>Richard advances as far as he dare: a few meters from them.</P>
  <P>He peers at them around the edge of the tree.</P>
  <P>He notices that the one nearest has left a knife on the ground.</P>
  <P>Richard lifts a stone and throws it high in the air beyond the farmers.</P>
  <P>As it falls through the trees to the forest floor the farmers are startled. 
  They stand and turn away towards the noise reaching for their guns, cocking 
  them, etc.</P>
  <P>The knife is taken by Richard.</P>
  <P>The farmers see a bird fly from a tree. Satisfied, they give up and return 
  to their resting place.</P>
  <P>Richard steals away from tree to tree.</P>
  <P>The farmer cannot understand where his knife has gone.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. DAY <I>

  leaves.</P>
  <P>He is using the knife to gut a bird of some sort which he then eats 
  raw.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>I hadn't entirely forgotten my purpose up here, but I wasn't worried about 
  it. I mean I didn't want one of those bastards turning up with my map sticking 
  out of his pocket, but if they did, it was going to be a challenge. It was a 
  mission, my mission, to defend our island.</P>

<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT/DAWN. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard, his face disrupted by mud, sneaks towards the rough shelter of 
  wooden planks and palm leaves under which the four farmers are 
  sleeping.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. EXT. SHELTER. NIGHT/DAWN. <I>
</b>  <P>The shelter is several meters long but shallow and is open down the length 
  of one side.</P>
  <P>This is the farmers' home on the island.</P>
  <P>It contains a collection of tools, arms, crates, bedding, food, cigarettes, 
  and bottles of cheap whiskey.</P>
  <P>Spaced out within the shelter, the four farmers are asleep on low pallets 
  or mats on the ground, each with their gun by their side.</P>
  <P>Richard enters the shelter and surveys the scene.</P>
  <P>He approaches the nearest farmer who lies asleep. He is wearing a bandana 
  which has slipped half off in his sleep.</P>
  <P>Very slowly, Richard reaches down and lifts the farmer's gun, a 
  Kalashnikov-type assult rifle.</P>
  <P>Richard holds the weapon, becoming comfortable with it.</P>
  <P>He lifts the butt to his shoulder and squints down the sight.</P>
  <P>He closes in on the farmer, so close that the muzzle is almost tickling the 
  farmer's nose.</P>
  <P>In his sleep, the farmer swats at his nose as he might swat at a fly. 
  Richard withdraws the gun a fraction.</P>
  <P>His finger strokes the trigger.</P>
  <P>He moves very carefully around the shelter, pointing the gun at each 
  sleeping farmer and mouthing "bang" as he goes.</P>
  <P>He returns to the first farmer and kneels beside him.</P>
  <P>The farmer is on his side, facing away from Richard. He stirs in his sleep 
  and wakes slightly.</P>
  <P>He reaches out behind him to feel for his gun. His hand feels the metal. He 
  relaxes and closes his eyes again.</P>
  <P>Behind him, Richard smiles and releases his own grip on the gun.</P>
  <P>Instead he lifts the bandana away from the farmer's head and puts it on his 
  own.</P>
  <P>Now he produces the knife from the back of his shorts.</P>
  <P>He kneels beside the farmer and holds the knife firmly.</P>
  <P>Abruptly he stabs it into the upright wooden plank behind the farmer's 
  head.</P>
  <P>The blade sinks deep into the wood.</P></I>

</b>  <P>Oh, that. She told you?</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>She told everyone. She believes in openness and honesty, not like 
  you.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Come on, you were two-timing Etienne.</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Because I liked you. I didn't know you were going to screw Sal twenty-four 
  hours later.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Well if you're going to make such a big deal out of it -</P><B>
<b>  <P>FRANCOISE</P></B>
</b>  <P>Bugs is going to kill you. And you know what - I don't care.</P><I>
  <P>She raises her hand and slaps him again.</P>
  <P>Richard does not flinch.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard enters the longhouse.</P>
  <P>Inside are several people, including Bugs, sitting at the far end.</P>
  <P>When they see that it is Richard, all conversation stops.</P>
  <P>One by one at first, then en masse, everyone except Bugs leaves the 
  longhouse, hurrying past Richard at the door.</P>
  <P>Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the longhouse.</P>
  <P>Richard smiles. He repeats the gesture that he made when returning with the 
  rice: he clutches his groin and thrusts towards Bugs.</P>
  <P>Bugs starts running towards Richard.</P>
  <P>Just as Bugs reaches him he takes evasive action, feinting to one side.</P>
  <P>Bugs, cursing, pursues Richard around the longhouse, each of them trampling 
  over possessions and partitions. Bugs is bigger but Richard is too sly and 
  nimble for him, taunting and mocking as he dodges around the narrow upright 
  supports that run down the middle of the building.</P>
  <P>Eventually Bugs has Richard cornered.</P>
  <P>They face each other, crouched slightly, breathing heavily.</P>
  <P>From outside a loud, horrified screaming begins.</P>
  <P>It carries on and on.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Don't you think we ought to go see what the problem is?</P><I>
  <P>Bugs pauses for a moment. He glances towards the door for a fraction of a 
  second.</P>
  <P>Richard slugs him in the jaw.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. CLEARING. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard emerges from the longhouse, flexing the fingers of his punching 
  hand.</P>
  <P>A crowd has gathered as he joins it.</P>
  <P>At the center are Karl, on his knees, wailing and shouting in Swedish, and 
  Sten, who has been savaged by a shark and looks dead. Despite his appearance, 
  Keaty and Gregorio are attempting to resuscitate him.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>Poor Karl: he didn't speak much English, but he only needed one 
word.</P><B>
<b>  <P>KARL</P></B>
</b>  <P>Shark! Shark!</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>They were trying to save Sten's life although even as a novice in this 
  field I could tell that just wasn't going to happen.</P><I>
  <P>Richard backs away.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>EXT. BEACH. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard walks along the shore and begins to follow a bloodstained furrow in 
  the sand.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>The way I saw it, sharks live in the sea, so if you go swimming where they 
  live, they might eat you. That's what sharks are good at, that's what they do. 
  I could have explained this to Christo but I just knew he wouldn't see 
  it.</P><I>
  <P>Richard is standing over Christo who is lying in agony on the 
  sand.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>CHRISTO</P></B>
</b>  <P>Richard! My foot. My foot! It's so painful. My foot!</P><I>
  <P>Richard looks at Christo's right leg: it has been bitten off beneath the 
  knee, leaving only a ragged bloody stump.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Yeah, your foot - it's - pretty bad.</P><I>
  <P>Christo clings to him.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>CHRISTO</P></B>
</b>  <P>But it will be ok? Please Richard, when I get to the hospital?</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Hospital?</P><B>
<b>  <P>CHRISTO</P></B>
</b>  <P>Tell me - it will be ok.</P><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>Yeah. Sure. Christo, it'll be ok.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. GRAVE STIE. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>A freshly dug grave in sandy soil about 1.5 meters deep.</P>
  <P>The corpse (Sten) in a sleeping bag is slung into the grave, its feet 
  protruding from the end.</P>
  <P>Immediately, the earth starts to be filled in from either side.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>KEATY</B> (O.S.)</P>
</b>  <P>We are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Sten. I couldn't 
  claim to know the bloke all that well but what I knew, I liked. He was a 
  straightforward, easy to get along with, reliable sort of guy. He worked hard 
  for the whole community - he even lost his life fishing for us.</P><I>
  <P>Keaty is addressing the entire community beside the grave while earth is 
  heaped on.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>KEATY</P></B>
</b>  <P>He made an effort to join in whatever was going on. For example, he played 
  cricket with an aptitude and enthusiasm that belied his Nordic origins, and I 
  think we can see that as a symbolic ofhis place amongst us in a wider sense. 
  Anyway, he wasn't one for long speeches, and neither am I. May God take you 
  soul, and you shall rest forever in peace mate. We'll miss you.</P><I>
  <P>Keaty holds back a tear as he throws a flower in the grave.</P>
  <P>Others throw flowers in.</P>
  <P>Bugs hammers a wooden cross into the ground behind the grave.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. <I>
</b>  <P>Christo is being nursed by Etienne who is mopping his brow, trying to get 
  him to drink etc.</P>
  <P>Several people are sitting around, inactive and silent.</P>
  <P>Christo moans. A couple of people get up and leave.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>After the funeral we all tried to get back to normal, but it just didn't 
  seem right. After a while it became clear that the problem was Christo. You 
  see, in a shark attack, or any other major tragedy I guess, the important 
  thing is to get eaten and die, in which case there's a funeral and someone 
  makes a speech and everyone cries and says what a good guy you were, or: get 
  better in which case everyone can forget about it. It's the hanging around in 
  between that really pisses people off.</P>
<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. DAY. <I>

<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>This is disgusting! You cannot do this! Take him back!</P><I>
  <P>A party of stretcher bearers, including Bugs, Sal, and Keaty, carry Christo 
  through the forest. Sal is carrying a small rolled up tent. Richard walks 
  behind.</P></I><B>

<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>It's not that they don't care, Etienne, it's just that they don't care in

<b>  <P>ETIENNE</P></B>
</b>  <P>I understand: they wish he was dead.</P><B>

  hand.</P></I>
<b>  <LI>INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. <I>

  <P>The farmers have gone.</P>
  <P>Sal lies injured on the floor.</P>
  <P>The inhabitants silently pass the map from one to the other.</P>

<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard's bald is at Etienne's throat.</P>
  <P>He opens his eyes, frozen with fear.</P>
  <P>Richard is aware of a gaze from another direction. Keeping the knife at 
  Etienne's throat, he turns to see that Francoise is looking at him. They stare 
  at each other.</P>
  <P>Richard takes the knife away.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>You have to leave. Do you understand? You have to leave right now. If you

<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>There is nothing more you can do. I'll look after him.</P><B>

</b>  <P>You don't have time to talk about this. You have to go now.</P><I>
  <P>Christo moans. Etienne looks at him.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</P></B>
</b>  <P>(continuing)</P>
  <P>Leave him with me.</P><I>
  <P>Etienne understands. He and Richard stare at each other.</P></I>

<b>  <LI>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <I>

<b>  <LI>INT. SMALL TENT. NIGHT. <I>
</b>  <P>Richard studies Christo, illuminated by a torch.</P>
  <P>His breathing is labored and irregular.</P>
  <P>Richard reaches forward. He pinches Christo's nose and covers his 
mouth.</P>
  <P>Christo's body struggles briefly and goes still.</P>
  <P>Richard relaxes his grip.</P>
  <P>He switches off the torch.</P></I>

  towards the underwater tunnel.</P></I>

  <P>Etienne and Francoise are in the boat.</P>
  <P>Etienne is trying to start the boat.</P>
  <P>He sees the silhouette of a man surface and crawl onto the flat rock.</P>
  <P>Etienne steps off the boat onto the rock as the figure in the shadows 
  approaches him.</P></I><B>

</b>  <P>Richard, come one, get into the boat.</P><I>
  <P>The man pulls Etienne forward and stabs him deep into his

  <P>Richard!</P><I>
  <P>It is Bugs.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>BUGS</P></B>
</b>  <P>Richard can't help you now, French boy.</P><I>
  <P>Francoise screams.</P>
  <P>Bugs releases Etienne who falls helpless to his knees.</P>
  <P>Bugs turns his attention to Francoise. She pulls the start cord and the 
  engine starts.</P>
  <P>Bugs holds one end of the mooring rope, pulling the boat towards him while 
  Francoise tries to undo the other end.</P></I><B>
<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (O.S.)</P>
</b>  <P>Hey, Bugs!</P><I>
  <P>Richard stands on the rock.</P>
  <P>Bugs turns towards him. He drops the rope and walks a couple of paces, then 
  rushes him.</P>
  <P>Richard manages to avoid the blade.</P>
  <P>They fight.</P>
  <P>Bugs forces Richard on to the ground</P>
  <P>He is about to stab Richard.</P>
  <P>Etienne appears behind Bugs, struggling on his feet, bleeding from his 
  wound.</P>
  <P>He is holding a piece of rope. He slings it around Bug's neck.</P>
  <P>Etienne's eyes roll and his head lolls.</P>
  <P>He falls back into the water, pulling Bugs with him.</P>

</b>  <P>That was the worst thing: I didn't even get to die. I had to live with 
  myself.</P>
<b>  <LI>INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY. <I>

<b>  <P>RICHARD</B> (V.O.)</P>
</b>  <P>Listening to all the people talk about where they're going to go and ho 
  great it's going to be, and I try to tell them: you can go too far, you can 
  find out too much, but no one ever listens, no one ever listens. I guess 
  there's some things you just have to discover for yourself.</P>
