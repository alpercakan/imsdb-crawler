    A hot muggy Georgia morning. A pickup truck comes around a
    corner and moves towards us. Inside, music plays on the
    radio. We can't quite see who's driving.

    The driver heads down the road. He beats his hand on the
    steering wheel to the rhythm of the music. The driver turns
    up the music. As the rhythm speeds, so does the truck.

</b>              Which brings us on to Dental
              Insurance. Generally speaking, when
              you receive care from a
              participating PDP dentist, your out-
              of-pocket expenses will typically
              be lower than if your were to
              accept care from a dentist outside
              the group. The law deems it illegal
              for dentists to charge any more
              than the network approves... But
              listen, in my three and a half
              years of experience in this
              business people mainly care about
              keeping their premiums low. So,
              each of you must be prepared to
              sell the network to your clients
              and always cater to their specific
              condition.

    Annoyed, the presenter turns momentarily to the truck.

    James is caught flat-footed. SOMEWHERE OFF a toilet flushes.

    He rounds the corner. No-one. Opens the bathroom door. Looks
    inside. Sniffs. Slams it and storms off down the corridor
    passing a sign outside his office that reads: GET ON UP.

</b>          Look, I suggest we just continue...
          OK. So. How does the program work?
          Initially, participating dentists
          undergo an extensive credentialing
          process which, if approved, allows
          customers to pay the minimum
          deductible allowed and the
          remainder is insured. But with non-
          participating dentists the cost per
          visit is much higher and comes
          completely out of pocket. So some
          people may want a high deductible
          because they have more to cover,
          but most common folks simply want
          the lowest possible plan... and
          remember our key takeaway!?

          about getting home to your own
          toilet in your own master bath on
          Beech Island, South Carolina. I
          gotta a bidet in my master bath.

He shakes his head.    James looks to a woman.

She shakes her head.

A woman nods.

</b>          What was just saying... Oh, that's
          right. Yes! You gotta take shit.
          So, after church, you speed back
          home and you run like hell to the

More sniggers from all over the room. James raises his gun
and KABLOOM!!!

James accidentally blasts an enormous hole in the ceiling.

SCREAMS AS EVERYONE HITS THE DECK.      James looks up the the
hole in the ceiling.

Then, as if told by God, James spins around and locks eyes
with the woman who used his bathroom. He approaches her.

</b>
     A wide, opulent looking club has taken residence in a huge
     antebellum home with wrap around porches.

     A crowd of Deep Southern white folk, in cocktail attire, fill
     both levels of the porches and spill out onto the lawn
     surrounding a BOXING RING.

     A GROUP OF SIX BLACK MUSICIANS FORM A DIXIELAND BAND. Without
     inspiration they play methodically to the all white crowd.

     A FAT, SWEATING ANNOUNCER, walks into the ring, grasps a
     dangling mic.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER

               event, the Augusta Country club is

               Ladies and gentlemen..The Battle...
               Royale!

     Music. HALF A DOZEN BLACK BOYS enter the ring. Hyped. A glove
     is pulled onto one hand. The other tied behind their backs.
     They are blind-folded.

     A WHITE MAN with a BUCKET OF WHITE PAINT daubs a number onto
     each boy's chest.

     DING! DING! The boys stagger out, blindly swinging. The crowd
     roars, bangs the tables as they stumble, lurch, in the baying
     din.

     The smallest of the boys stands stiff. He struggles to throw
     much less land a punch. The number "One" is painted on his
     chest.

     A much bigger boy, "Number Six" punches "One" in the gut.
     "One" goes down but then slowly rises.

The dixieland band watches the exploitation with both horror
and intrigue as they can't help but wonder who will be left
standing.

The band's sound begins to change. It becomes as energized
as the match before them. They sink into the rhythm, and the
effect is one of heightened energy.

The drummer begins to pull the beat and the bass player
instantly follows suit finding the new pocket. The drummer
and bass player share a glance.

This inspired pocket soars across the lawn and into the ears
of boy "Number One".

We are now transported into the mind of "Number One".
Complete silence except for the sound of the band. Then one
by one all other instruments fade away leaving only the drum
and bass.

James turns to the band and lowers his blindfold from over
one eye. He catches eyes with the drummer and bass player.
The drummer nods at James and smiles.

James nods back and closes his eye. The sound morphs again as
"Number One" begins to arrange the music in his head to his
own liking.

James opens his one eye and sees only the drummer and bass
player on the stage. They are now playing what we and James
are hearing in his head.

James covers his eye again with the blindfold and forms a
slight smile. His stance becomes more relaxed. His body
begins to swing and morph like rubber.

He throws a punch. IT LANDS.

ALL AT ONCE "Number One" dances forward, dips, swings and
sweetly CONNECTS to "Number Four". As the vanquished head
hits the canvas, the victor, "Number One", bloodied, panting
in the waves of laughter and summer heat, stands alone.

As the boys hit the deck and are deemed "out" they are pulled
off the mat and carried to the bed of a parked truck.

"Three" goes down. Then "Two" and "Five". A ringside punter
THUMPS the canvas with a fistful of dollars, berating him.
People screaming with laughter. Only "One" and "Six" remain.
Panicky, jerky, they stalk one another. Listening.

"Number One" connects with lighting speed. "Six" removes his
blindfold, jumps off the ring and runs across the lawn
disappearing into the nearby woods.

</b>

     "Number One" stands victorious. The crowd goes wild. "Number
     One" absorbs the admiration as he slowly pushes up the
     blindfold and looks toward the bandstand.

     All the band members have returned to the stand as in reality
     they always were. They clap wildly as the beat and rhythm of
     this budding continues in his head.

     THE EIGHT YEAR OLD JAMES BROWN LOOKS RIGHT AT US. A level
     gaze. That million dollar smile, teeth coated with blood.

     feet and punches the BIG KID and fights back fearlessly.

     Way off in the distance he hears music and singing. He gets
     out of bed.

     He passes a room, TWO SOLDIERS wait their turn with one of

     James reaches the front of the house. He looks to Honey, out
     cold in a chair. A needle protrudes from her harm.

      right at us. He begins to smile.

          Gentlemen, James Brown doesn't need
          the Famous Flames. King records and

          Flames. But James has requested
          that the name remain in some form.

          from now on you work for James

      back at him. She holds a notebook and pen.

      She nods.

      James approaches and tries to grab the notebook.   She pulls
      it back from his grasp with a smile

          exactly do you call your style of
          music?

<b>                    JAMES BROWN
</b>          I call it James Brown music. What
          I mean is, it's so far ahead of
          it's time that they ain't got a
          name for it yet. Take another
          record, any record from your stack
          at home. I don't care if it's from
          Motown or Stax or whatever...and
          put it on your box. None of them
          are gonna sound like mine. Not
          even my own old records. Just like
          the title says, it's a "new bag".
          See the funk is in the bass. The
          bass never changes. It's a groove,
          lady. Soon as you hear that
          groove, I know I got you.

</b>          And what exactly is the groove?

<b>                    JAMES BROWN
</b>          The groove is something you feel.
          The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It
          don't move. It's like a heartbeat.
          It's inside you, driving
          everything. Hard. Flat. A groove.

police. Tense promoters and politicians to the beating
rhythms.

The band whipcrack into I GOT THE FEELING. James pulsates.
Spins. Pushes the stand away. Zip! It's back.

A kid at the front gets onto the stage and sprints for James
only to be tackled by James' security. Another clambers up
but is kicked back by a police officer. The audience react
badly.

Another kid gets on stage and cops harshly push him to the
floor and throw him back into the audience. Police come out
onto the right side of the stage and shine torches down into
the audience. They shove people back down.

A kid in a white jacket leaps on stage right in front of
James. For a moment everyone stops. A white cop appears from
nowhere and viciously bodychecks the kid back into the front
row in full view of the cameras.

The mayor stands in the wings flanked by policemen.   Dede
stands behind them watching nervously.

and whistles from the audience.

the audience. He seems amazed to find himself there.

eye to eye. Kids throng around him on stage. He's losing

       A casket lays at the bottom of a grave that has been dug.
       TEN MALE FUNERAL ATTENDEES IN SUITS AND YAMMAKAS take turns
       shoveling dirt onto Ben Bart's casket.

       Dede and James stand to the side. Completely distraught.
       James starts to panic and lowers to the ground. Dede catches
       him under the arm.

       One of the men approach James with the shovel.      James can't

       BAND MEMBERS FITTED WITH THEIR AFRICAN DASHIKIS are rolling a
       funky vamp together into a groove. Clyde hits a fat `pop pop'
       beat. Sweet Charles locks the bass line in to the beat.
       Country finds a chunky B-flat-9 rhythm on the guitar and the
       groove takes shape.

The band starts. James makes a few adjustments. Jimmy Nolen
strikes up a womp-womp sound on a single string. The horns do
the James trademark ladidadidat.

black, except for a few Mexican children. Dede and Teddy are
there, along with some of James' other kids.

around Teddy as he addresses the kids.
